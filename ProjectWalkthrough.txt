Key points:

- KISS principle
	- The application is now easier to read, understand, and maintain
	- The art also follow the principle. Simple shapes, animations, and effects add a lot to the project without the need for professional art

- Decoupling data and representation
	- The GamePlay class was very confusing. The new structure isolates data, business logic, and views

- Composition over inheritance
	- Composition is one of the cornerstones of good unity design and I used it throughout the project 

- Single responsibility principle
	- The GamePlay class had a lot of responsibilities and I divided then with other classes

- Application of design patterns where possible
	- Design patterns were applied where needed, you will find implemented the Observer pattern, Provider pattern, and Singleton pattern


Summary of major changes:

- Created project with .gitignore
- Updated the project to Unity 2020.3 LTS to be able to use some new features
- Added the following packages:
	- TextMesh pro: a better option for text
	- LeanTween: for animations and interpolation. UI animations using the animator may slow down the game because the canvas redraw every frame
	- Device simulator: it is a better option run the game in the editor in comparison to the Game window. It is not available for unity 2018
- Changed the build target to Android. I wanted to make a mobile app and iOS would require a lot of extra steps to distribute the game
- Imported a 'Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal' licensed font: https://kylamber.itch.io/diman-squares
- There was no adition of any other art asset. The sprites used are Unity's default
- Reorganized folder structure
- Configured a good canvas scaler that display the application correctly on smartphones and tablets. It can also work on landscape monitors but it is not well tested
- Created a color palette
- Restructure the hierarchy of Main Menu and Gameplay scenes
- Remade Main Menu UI
- Created a navigation and scene transition component "Navigator.cs" and "SceneTransitionCanvas.prefab"
- Updated ball and player prefabs to use sprites instead of mesh
- Recreated the gameplay interface, added effects and particles
- Created a component responsible for user input "GameInputManager.cs"
- Distributed the responsibilities of "GamePlay.cs" with "PlayerController.cs" and "BallController.cs"
- Changed the GamePlay scene to load levels from a scriptable object
- Added mobile controls. Keyboards can still be used
- Created a Level Provider that takes advantage of addressables "LevelsProvider.cs"
- Switch win and lose scene for dialogs
- Created a Dialog Provider that takes advantage of addressables "DialogProvider.cs". The advantage of using this structure is that we can show dialogs with no memory and processing impact during gameplay
- Added support for multiple levels
- Added a simple level editor as a scriptable object "LevelScriptableObject.cs"
- Cleanup the code, remove small unrecommended practices like "GetComponent()" inside update, physics operation inside "FixedUpdate()" instead "Update()", etc
- Gameplay used a singleton pattern that was causing all sorts of problems I removed it
- Separate "Gameplay.cs" into "Game.cs" for business logic, "GameplayData.cs" for data, and "GameplayView.cs" for presentation. "IGameplayView.cs" was the interface used as a contract
- Build the game for Android


Final considerations:

My goal with this project was to demonstrate my skills as a programmer and my knowledge of the Unity engine, I believe that even a small project like benefits a lot from techniques like Addressables and Scriptable objects.
